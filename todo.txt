Aim:        Develop an app using the Flask module. The app is an
            online grocery store and the name of the store is 'NovaCart'

Properties: (i) As of now, I have only considred upto three tables: 
            Users, Categories(of the items), Items. Of course, more will
            be needed (for storing items in cart, maybe)
            (ii) It should have one admin, who can add new things, edit old things and
            delete old things. So there is a seperate login page for the admin
            (iii) Then there is also a user-login page. The user passwords are stored in
            the Users table. The user can also change their details at any time.
            (iv) In the hoempage of the app, there should be the user can either view the items randomly,
            or also search for them on the basis of the Category of the items
            (v) The three tables mentioned above have the following fields:
                1) Name: User
                   Fields: name, email, fav_color(used this for testing), hashed_password
                2) Name: Category
                   Fields: cat_name, cat_description
                3) Name: Items
                   Fields: item_name, item_price, date_added, available, item_img(to be displayed in the homepage and also the item-page)
                NOTE: id is, of course, to be defined for each of the table
            (vi) As of now, I have used a sqlite database SQLAlchemy as well for database
            management. Whenever I had to make chages to the database, I use 'flask migrate' to update the
            database as well
            (vii) I also have a (currently) unuseable search box in the navbar. Maybe this could be used for
            searching for items or categories by the user
