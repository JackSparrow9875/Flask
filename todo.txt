1) make changes so that if there is the string 'error' in flashed messages
   it gets displyed in color red, else in color green
2) have to make another table for items. as of now, I am thinking of having around
   5 items per category. may increase it later. we also have to link it with the
   category table.
3) as of now, I have decided to make the shopping thing in the homepage only on the
   basis of categories
